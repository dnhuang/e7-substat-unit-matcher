Was bored one day and decided to start a new mobile game called [Cookie Run Kingdom](https://www.cookierun-kingdom.com/en/).

Upon my playthrough, I became curious about the change in exp required per cookie level up, as it was starting to get tedious.

Manually inputted data obtained from the [fandom wiki](https://cookierunkingdom.fandom.com/wiki/Cookie_Upgrading#:~:text=At%20launch%2C%20the%20maximum%20Level,current%20maximum%20Level%20is%2075.&text=There%20is%20a%20Desmos%20Graph,based%20on%20the%20table%20above.) in `exp.csv`.

Exp curve plot can be seen in `crk.ipynb`.
